====== ROS ======

ROS is a robot operating system which comes with a lot of handy tools.
For now, the package ''ros-indigo-desktop'' (without Gazebo) has been tested in combination with ''Ubuntu 14.04.4''.
This package contains a [[http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20broadcaster%20(C%2B%2B)|tf]] broadcaster and sensor bridges, to get the the project into the ROS world.

===== Prerequisites to Initialize the Workspace =====

  * ''source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.sh''
  * ''cd ${MUROX_PROJECT}/ros/src''
  * ''catkin_init_workspace''

===== Transforms and Frames =====

To see the machine fames, first of all the static tranforms can be published and visualized in the following way:

  * Start the static tf's: ''cd ${MUROX_PROJECT}/ros && source devel/setup.sh && catkin_make && roslaunch claas_tf start.launch''
  * In another console: ''rosrun rviz rviz''
